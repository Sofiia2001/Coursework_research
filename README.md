Coursework research is a research of dependace of suicidal posts in Twitter and official suicide countries rates.

It is mainly directed to examine Tweets' hashtags connected to suicidal thougths, gather data based on Tweets location
or user location if the first one is not pinned. Then, creating statistics by amount of posts in various countries.
The next step is to compare official data and the one that was gathered from Twitter.

On a current stage, a file testing_api.py is testing Twitter API and abilities, that can be presented by tweepy library
in working with Twitter API. Unfortunately, I cannot share a hidden module in case of private policy, that was signed
when getting Twitter API keys.

It also has functions to write gathered data into .json and .csv files. There are examples of files(testing_api.json and
testing_api.csv) of such formats and you can easily access them.

Warning: testing_api.py is only a TESTING module, that checks work of libraries and modules I use for my research.
